  <p class="subtitle"> For most of us, sleeping on a full stomach is probably a routine, yet millions of people all over the world actually sleep on an empty stomach. Only because they lack the necessary resources, finance, access to food, and so on.</p>

  <div class="facts"><h3><strong>WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF HUNGER?</strong></h3>
  <p>Here are some widely accepted definitions of key terms:
    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
      <li>Hunger is the distress associated with lack of food. The threshold for food deprivation, or undernourishment, is fewer than 1,800 calories per day.</li>
      <li>Undernutrition goes beyond calories to signify deficiencies in <u class="underline">energy, protein, and/or essential vitamins and minerals. </u></li>
      <li>Malnutrition refers more broadly to both <u class="underline">undernutrition and overnutrition </u>(problems with unbalanced diets).</li>
      <li>Food security relates to <u class="underline">food availability, access, and utilization.</u> When a person always has adequate availability and access to enough safe and 
          nutritious food to maintain an active and healthy life, they are considered food secure.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="facts-two"><h4><strong>Around the world, more than enough food is produced to feed the global populationâ€”but as many as 829 million people still go hungry. After steadily declining for a decade, world hunger is on the rise, affecting nearly 10% percent of people globally. From 2019 to 2022, the number of undernourished people grew by as many as 150 million, a crisis driven largely by conflict, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong></h4>
